# Supervised-Learning-Final-Project

In this repository, you will find the Jupyter notebooks corresponding to the final project submission for the Supervised Learning Module of the Machine Learning subject in the Artificial Intelligence Specialization, virtual modality, at Universidad Autonoma de Occidente.

For the project to be understood and reviewed, the notebooks should be read in numerical order, as follows:
1. 1_project_description.ipynb
2. 2_2_create_fy2023_all_contracts_csv.ipynb
3. 3_create_labels_for_fy_2023_companies.ipynb
4. 4_classification_models.ipynb

Each notebook accounts for each aspect of the project, from its description, through the acquisition and extraction of data, the creation of labels or classes, to the creation of classification models.
